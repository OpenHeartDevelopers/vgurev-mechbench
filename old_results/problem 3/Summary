Methods. Fully incompressible, quadratic displacement, linear pressure tetrahedral, hexahedral, pyramid and triangular prism finite elements.

Visualization. Cardioid uses hex-dominant meshes with nodes on edges, faces and interior of the finite elements to interpolate quadratic displacement field. 
However, all non-vertex nodes are dropped in output vtk files, and deformations are presented using linear elements.  
Strain is computed at the center of each finite element (average coordinate of the vertex node). 
Scalar fields Exx, Eyy, Ezz, â€¦ in vtk files are components of Green-Lagrangian strain tensor mapped on deformed geometry. 
Eff is the strain in the fiber direction.

Apex singularity. To avoid singularity of fiber directions at the apex, we set isotropic properties of the material for triangular prism elements at the apex, 
 and constitutive law for isotropic material is the same as in the Problem 2 with passive ventricular mechanics.
Therefore, fiber strain at the apex should be ignored in vtk files.

The apical region needs to be treated as a purely passive part (spans 4 elements from the apical point). 
The attached LVmodel.png shows the region with contractility, the apical region is not included. 
The isotropic material model from Problem 2 is used, but 10 times stiffer than that in Problem 2. 
Due to the relative large passive region, the final deformed LV volume will be larger than the model without assuming passive apex. 

Initial results:
epi apical position   (0, 0, -15.22) mm
endo apical position  (0, 0, -13.82) mm
LV cavity volume:     1900 mm^3
