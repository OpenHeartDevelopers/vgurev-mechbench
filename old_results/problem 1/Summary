* Cardioid

Methods. Fully incompressible, quadratic displacement, linear pressure tetrahedral, hexahedral, pyramid and triangular prism finite elements.

Visualization. Cardioid uses hex-dominant meshes with nodes on edges, faces and interior of the finite elements to interpolate quadratic displacement field. However, all non-vertex nodes are dropped in output vtk files, and deformations are presented using linear elements.  
Strain is computed at the center of each finite element (average coordinate of the vertex node). Scalar fields Exx, Eyy, Ezz, â€¦ in vtk files are components of Green-Lagrangian strain tensor mapped on deformed geometry. Eff is the strain in the fiber direction.

Problem 1: pressure loaded bar
The beam is meshed with linear hex element, total number is 40x4x4. The pressure was linearly ramped to the maximum value in 1s,
   and maintained for further 2s till the simulation reaches steady state. The results are post-processed after reaching steady state.
 The deformed position for the furthest point is (9.229, 1, 4.05871) mm
