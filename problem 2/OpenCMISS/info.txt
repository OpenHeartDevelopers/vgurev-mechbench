Numerical methods (FE, basis type,incompressibility type) : 
- Trilinear hexahedral finite elements for geometry. Constant element-based pressure, Lagrange multiplier. 

- The degrees of freedom (DOF) include the displacement field and the hydrostatic pressure field, and include fixed/dirichlet DOFs. 

Meshes in order are:
transmural x circumferential x longitudinal
8x32x32
