Numerical methods (FE, basis type,incompressibility type) : 
- Tricubic Hermite hexahedral finite elements for deformation, linear elements for pressure, Lagrange multiplier. 

- The degrees of freedom (DOF) include the displacement field and the hydrostatic pressure field, and include fixed/dirichlet DOFs. 

- Smaller elements at the fixed end to get more accurate solutions. 

Meshes in order are
