Numerical methods: incompressible material, with updated material parameters after the first draft
- implemented with IB/FE method (immersed boundary method with finite element discretization for structure). 
- using dynamic simulation to approximate the steady state problem. The loading and boundary conditions are maintained until reaching steady state. 
- The beam is meshed with linear hex element, total number is 40x4x4, and immersed in a 20x7x15 mm fluid box.
- nodal displacements and Cauchy strain fileds are reported

test cases, the sturctural mesh is the same
test 1: the fluid box is discretized with 100x35x75
test 2: the fluid box is discretized with 120x42x90
