Numerical methods (FE, basis type,incompressibility type) : 

A Q1P0 scheme was used.
The incompressibility was carried out using the Lagrange Multipiler approach described by Bonet's nonlinear mechanics book. 

When visualizing in Paraview, the following fields are available:
    u: displacement
    J: the element jacobian.
    p: the hydrostatic pressure (the lagrange multiplier term).
    E_f: the Euler Strain, in the local fiber coordinate system.
    T_active/passive: the active/passive stress tensor, in the local fiber coordinate system.

The degrees of freedom (DOF) include the displacement field and the hydrostatic pressure field. 
Given the Q1P0 scheme, the total DOF_number = node_number *3 + elements_number
