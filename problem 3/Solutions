For each solution provided, please use the following strucutre:

A folder 'Name of the code', containing
1. The attached text file 'info.txt' with the information filled in.
2. For each solution provided, a folder named after the number of degrees of freedom of that solution.
2a. A file undeformed.vtk containing the undeformed mesh
2b. A file deformed.vtk containing the deformed mesh, with identical topology to undeformed.vtk. OPTIONAL: Include a node or element based strain field (E)

Please note the 'number of degrees of freedom' is that used in your code to calculate the solution, even though this may be different from the vtk file. 
Furthermore, the vtk files should be text-based rather than binary.
